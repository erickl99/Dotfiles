# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles on my arch linux system. You probably don't want to use these directly, but feel free to look at them
for reference.
## .scripts
A small collection of scripts that I use to set my status bar in DWM, the suckless window manager.
## .templates
This file is used in tandem with my vimrc. Currently, it is a collection of html templates that I find useful to be able to paste into a file quickly.
## .vimrc
Self-explanatory
## .bashrc
Self-explanatory
